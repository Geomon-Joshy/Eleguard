## AIM
The motive of this project is to build an echo friendly , ecnomical device to minimise interactions between wikd elephants and human cultivations without causing any physicl or any other modes of loos to both parties.

## ABSTRACT
These days, Unhealthy interactions between elephants and human cultivations are really common. Allthough there are measure taken to prevent this they are not very effective. Hence we have build a device to do this.<br>
**B**ased on some information that we collected and what is on intrenet we understood few things:-
<ul>
<li> Herds of elephants enter crops because it is on their ancient paths to water holes.</li>
<li> Bull elephants in their musk period wander around searching for a mate .(Occurs only during a certain period of time)</li>
<li> Elephants wander in search of food. (Even though this seems to be the obvious reason in reality it is the most unlikely). only way to prevent this is aforestation</li>
</ul>
By putting the obvious factors into consideration we was able to design a device (Using simple ultra_sonic sensores and Arduino) to detect the precesence of elephants (Herds and  bulls separately). Using this information we trigger a 3-d speaker which produces sounds of watering hole (for herds of elephants) and female matting calls (For bull elephans).THe speakers are set in such a way that the sound seems to appearing from deep inside the forest and the elephants are tricked to be returning to the forest following the  imaginary voices from the speakers.
