## AIM
The motive of this project is to build an echo friendly , ecnomical device to minimise interactions between wikd elephants and human cultivations without causing any physicl or any other modes of loos to both parties.

## ABSTRACT
These days, Unhealthy interaction between elephants and human cultivations is really common. Allthough there are measure taken to prevent this they are not very effective. Hence we have build a device to do this.
**B**ased on some information that we collected and what is on intrenet we understood few things:-
<ul>
<li> Herds of elephants enter crops because it is on their ancient paths to water holes.</li>
<li> Bull elephants in their musk period wander around searching for a mate .(Occurs only during a certain period of time)</l>
</ul>
